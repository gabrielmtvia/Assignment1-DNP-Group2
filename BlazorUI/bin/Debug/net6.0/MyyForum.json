    "Description": "Based on Min Jin Lee\u0027s bestselling 2017 novel, the story centres on Sunja, played as a girl by Yu-na Jeon, in a delightful performance. For much of the story, Min-ha Kim plays her as a young woman who moves to Japan with her husband, a Korean minister. But the true heart of the series is Yuh-jung Youn, who won last year\u0027s best supporting actress Oscar as the blunt but warm grandmother in Minari. She plays the older Sunja, who lives in Osaka with her son, Mozasu (Soji Arai), the owner of pachinko gaming parlours (arcades popular in Japan where people play a game resembling pinball). All three actresses mesh perfectly, depicting a life that includes a misbegotten romance in Korea, and years of hard work in Japan selling kimchi from a street cart to support her family. The oldest Sunja\u0027s calm but expressive face contains them all. Wise, observant, deeply feeling and still troubled, she carries the weight of her personal past and of history.   ",

    "Description": "The film has its genesis in the largely autobiographical 1939 novel Goodbye to Berlin by Christopher Isherwood, who had travelled to the city in 1929 in pursuit of its vibrant gay scene. There, he lived among a crowd of misfits, who formed the basis for the likes of the ambitiously bright-eyed Sally Bowles and the provocative Master of Ceremonies, who was played by Joel Grey in the 1972 film (and who beat Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall to the best supporting actor Oscar). While sex between men was illegal there as it was in Britain, Berlin became a magnet for sex tourism and hundreds of gay bars appeared throughout the city. What Isherwood found was a country blindly barrelling into the abyss as its inhabitants drowned in decadence. Anti-Semitism was on the rise, Nazi rallies doubled, trebled and quadrupled in size and the bohemians \u2013 gay people, communists \u2013 all living like every year was their last, were soon to be purged and imprisoned in concentration camps alongside the Jews (Sam Mendes\u0027 1993 theatrical adaptation of the musical ended on this very grim note).\n\n",
